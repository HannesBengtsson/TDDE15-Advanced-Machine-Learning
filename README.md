# ðŸ¤– TDDE15 - Advanced Machine Learning

TDDE15 is a Machine Learning course taught at LinkÃ¶ping University, Sweden. I attended it during the fall of 2023. The course cover four main topics that all have one lab associated with it: Graphical Models, Hidden Markov Models, Reinforcement learning, and Gaussian Process Regression and Classification. Please see further details for each topic below.

### [Lab 1](https://github.com/HannesBengtsson/TDDE15-Advanced-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Lab-1-Graphical-Models) â€“ Graphical Models

**Exercise 1 â€“ Hill-Climbing Algorithm:** Explored the hill-climbing algorithm showing that it can generate non-equivalent Bayesian network structures and explained why this happens.

**Exercise 2 â€“ Learn a BN:** Learned a Bayesian network from 80% of the dataset, including structure and parameters. Used the learned network to classify the remaining 20% of the data into two classes. Reported the confusion matrix and compared my results to the true BN.

**Exercise 3 â€“ Classify based on the Markov Blanket:** Classified the target variable based only on its Markov blanket and reported the confusion matrix.

**Exercise 4 â€“ Naive Bayes Classifier:** Repeated the classification from exercise 2 using a manually created naive Bayes classifier as a Bayesian network.
